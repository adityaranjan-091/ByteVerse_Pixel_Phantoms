## üß© Problem Statement

Every day, millions of tons of edible food are wasted globally while millions go hungry. The primary challenges include:

- ‚ùå Lack of coordination between food donors and recipients
- ‚ùå No centralized platform for surplus food redistribution
- ‚ùå Limited visibility of food availability in real-time
- ‚ùå Trust and safety concerns in food donation
- ‚ùå Inefficient logistics and distribution channels

**SustainBite** addresses these challenges by providing a secure, efficient, and transparent platform that makes food rescue accessible to everyone.
